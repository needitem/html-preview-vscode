An extension to preview HTML files while editing them in VSCode

The extension can be activated in two ways

* Toggle Preview - `ctrl+shift+v` or `cmd+shift+v`
* Open Preview to the Side - `ctrl+k v` or `cmd+k v`

## New: Click Element to Focus Code

- Click any element in the preview to reveal and focus the corresponding HTML source line in the editor.
- The clicked element is highlighted in the preview so you can see whatâ€™s selected.
- Works best when elements have an `id` or representative `class`.
